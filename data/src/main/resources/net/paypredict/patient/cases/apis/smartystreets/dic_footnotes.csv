T,Multiple response due to magnet street syndrome,"The search resulted in a single response; however, the record matched was flagged as having magnet street syndrome, and the input street name components (pre-directional, primary street name, post-directional, and suffix) did not exactly match those of the record. A ""magnet street"" is one having a primary street name that is also a suffix or directional word, having either a post-directional or a suffix (i.e., 2220 PARK MEMPHIS TN logically matches to a ZIP+4 record 2200-2258 PARK AVE MEMPHIS TN 38114-6610), but the input address lacks the suffix ""AVE"" which is present on the ZIP+4 record. The primary street name ""PARK"" is a suffix word. The record has either a suffix or a post-directional present. Therefore, in accordance with CASS requirements, a ZIP+4 Code must not be returned. The multiple response return code is given since a ""no match"" would prevent the best candidate.",
